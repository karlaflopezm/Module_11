##Mars Weather Analysis

###Overview

This project investigates the weather patterns on Mars using data from seasonal and monthly divisions. The analysis explores various parameters such as temperature and atmospheric pressure to better understand Martian climate conditions. It leverages the concept of Mars' 12-month division, based on its orbital position around the Sun, for structuring the data.

###Key Insights

Year Length: Mars has a year that spans 687 Earth days, with 12 arbitrarily divided months, each significantly longer than Earth's months.

Temperature Patterns: Mars experiences extremely low temperatures, with significant seasonal fluctuations.

Atmospheric Pressure: The pressure varies moderately throughout the year, reflecting seasonal changes.

###Data Sources

The data used in this analysis includes temperature and atmospheric pressure readings, structured into Martian months and seasons for easier interpretation.

###Visualizations

Average Minimum Temperature by Month: Highlights the consistently freezing temperatures across all months, with slight seasonal variations.

Average Pressure by Month: Demonstrates the fluctuation of atmospheric pressure throughout the Martian year, with dips and peaks correlating to seasonal changes.

###How to Use

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as matplotlib and pandas.

Run the Notebook: The analysis is contained within the Jupyter Notebook (part_2_mars_weather.ipynb). Open it and execute the cells to generate the visualizations.

Explore the Results: Analyze the provided graphs and data to draw conclusions about Martian weather patterns.

###Future Work

Incorporate more detailed datasets, such as wind speed or dust storm frequency.

Refine visualizations for improved clarity and readability.

Extend the analysis to compare Martian and Earth weather systems.

###Conclusion

This project provides a foundational look into Martian weather, leveraging data and visualizations to better understand the planet's extreme climate. It serves as a stepping stone for further research into Mars' environment and its potential for supporting future exploration.
